We use external websites to track the price of products while buying stuff from E-Commerce websites. 
I tried to show the price history of every book for the last 30 days so that the user don't have to rely on external websites.
Also, I displayed "Lowest Price" prompt to the user if the book's price was lowest in the last 30 days.
